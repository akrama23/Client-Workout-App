# Front-end Client-Workout-App
Front-end for the Workout App

#First Download Back-End and run the server. All steps on how to clone and deploy backend are available on the link below :)

#Clone Ruby on Rails back-end here ---> https://github.com/akrama23/Workout-app

#Front end cloning process below introduction

# Welcome to the Wokeout App
-Learn to weightlift by accessing a series workouts. For each workout the user can see a list of targeted muscles or watch a how-to video on the specific workout. Users can also create new workouts to add to our database.

● Developed a Ruby on Rails API backend in order to create seeded data and React front-end to fetch data from the Rails backend.

● Utilized JSON web Tokens and local storage to store encrypted user information on the client-side and bcrypt, JWT on server-side in order to encrypt user passwords in the backend.

● Managed Rails backend routing to fetch database information.

● Took advantage of client-side React routing in order to minimize load time for user data

● Implemented the user interface with fully CSS styling


# How to Clone Front-End for deployment on local machine :)

1. Clone down and change directory into app on local machine by 'cd Client-Workout-App'

2. Change directory into 'client' folder by running 'cd client' and then run 'npm install'

3. Run 'npm start' to get started with the demo

# Currently working on:

-More design through css. Add flexbox and grid layout

-Add a like button functionality to see which workouts are the most liked.

-Edit profile pages for users for a more user-friendly UI
