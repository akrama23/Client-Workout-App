# Front-end Client-Workout-App
Front-end for the Workout App

#Clone Ruby on Rails back-end here ---> https://github.com/akrama23/Workout-app

#Front end cloning process below introduction :)

# Welcome to the Wokeout App
-Learn to weightlift by accessing a series workouts. For each workout the user can see a list of targeted muscles or watch a how-to video on the specific workout. Users can also create new workouts to add to our database.

● Developed a Ruby on Rails API backend in order to create seeded data and React front-end to fetch data from the Rails backend.

● Utilized JSON web Tokens and local storage to store encrypted user information on the client-side and bcrypt, JWT on server-side in order to encrypt user passwords in the backend.

● Managed Rails backend routing to fetch database information.

● Took advantage of client-side React routing in order to minimize load time for user data

● Implemented the user interface with fully CSS styling
